# WebGL Headless Rendering Example

Sample repository for WebGL headless rendering powered by Puppeteer, which seems to work correctly for MacOS.

Created due to help with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61239552/unity3d-webgl-headless-not-rendering.

## Basic Setup

1. Install NodeJS (10.x or higher is recommended)
2. Fork and clone the repo
3. Install Yarn globally with `$ npm i -g yarn` or download it at their [website](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
4. `$ yarn` in the repo directory to install dependencies
5. `$ yarn server`in the repo directory to start python server
6. `$ yarn start` and open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in the browser
